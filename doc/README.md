## Diagrams

The diagrams used to show how the software is built and deployed were created using PlantUML.  There is an easy to use PlantUML extension for VS Code, and documentation and examples on the PlantUML website.

Note that PlantUML generates diagrams from text descriptions, you don't draw the diagrams.  If you prefer to draw diagrams, these can be done by hand, using a generic drawing package, or with specialized software such as Visual Paradigm.
